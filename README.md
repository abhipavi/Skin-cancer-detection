# Skin-cancer-detection
In this project the deep learning model will be developed using Python,Tensorflow
and Keras API. The problem will be approached using two methods.
The first method is a hard coded CNN approach and the second
method a transfer learning approach will be used. The dataset that
is used to train the models are the HAM10000 dataset

A three layer standard CNN is used in the first approach.
An Efficient-Nets architecture is used in the transfer learning approach.
